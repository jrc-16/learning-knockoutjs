This introduction illustrates some of the key points of MVVM:

- You've got a clean, object-oriented representation of your UI's data and behaviors (your viewmodel)

- Separately, you've got a declarative representation of how it should be displayed visibly (your view)

- You can implement arbitrarily sophisticated behaviors just by updating the viewmodel object. You don't have to worry about which DOM elements need to be changed/added/removed - the framework can take care of synchronizing things for you.
